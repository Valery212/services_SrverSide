# services_SrverSide
Basic rules: 
Here will be all the services code mostly implemented on JAVA. Some basic rules: all the code that is committed to the main branch should be final and tested at your local machine by the written test for that code. 
There will be a side brunch for Automated tests. That brunch should be treated as a main brunch that includes all the rules that apply for the main branch for the test branch. 
Code which is not final should be stored in a side branch. There will be Multiple branches every developer can open a new one if needed.
Plz don't edit this file without informing me.
